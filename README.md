# About this project
## Summary
Simple NLP to look for Covid Symptoms in patient notes to flag the patient with possible Covid19

## Challenges
Lack of availabiltity of anonimized 3rd party dataset that would also contain information that can be used for population and geographic analysis.

## Conclusions
Using NLP it is very possible to determine if the patient has Covid based on symptoms. 

## Cool Techniques
Data Cleaning
NLP
Matplotlib

## What Else I might have done
1. Figure out which how often the a symptom occurs and graph/plot it.
2. Figure out the highest count of symptoms from one patient. Will help to determine if multiple symptoms cause Covid
